# Stripe.com payment gateway plugin for Opencart / Copona.

I have combined multiple Stripe free plugins, to expand one another functionality.
I believe, commercial plugins still will offer best functionality. 

I will try to maintain this plugin to support latest Opencart 2 versiona and latest Copona.

No VQMOD or OCMOD! vqmod and ocmod is not and will not be supported. 

This plugin is mainly for developers, so please, contribute!
